Will leave most of the Read.me data from Create React App Boilerplate.
- Running yarn and yarn start will automatically open localhost:3000 to your default browser.
- Works with a running instance of the local server you provided.

- How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
  - Besides React and Redux, I opted to use Semantic UI React Framework because of the clean and neutral colored designs, and the fact that it has a pre-made Comments Component, which made my task of creating a comments section easier.
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
  - I could have definitely spent more time trying to figure out why the cards on the first page all lined up top to bottom instead of flowing left to right.
- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
  - I would probably create a tab of the 2 pages so that it's easier to switch back and forth between them. It should also remember the last selected candidate and change the second page once another candidate Response page was selected to show.

Thank you for the opportunity!
